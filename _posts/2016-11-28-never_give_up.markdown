Plenty of people have asked me why I have decided to essentially go back to school to change careers when I already have two bachelor degrees and a decent job.  The simple answer is my desire for happiness.  Now we will dive in to the longer answer.

While happiness is the main key, I also have a desire to always achieve my goals, now matter how high I set the bar.  I got my second Bachelor's degree in Accounting because I love numbers and had a goal to become a CPA and use that to further my career in the business world.  I successfully completed that degree and then went on to study and pass the 4 CPA exams.  However, I have been unable to meet the work requirements to actually obtain my CPA license.  I applied for over 20 jobs and never had success.  I did not have inside connections to any jobs, and unfortunately the one job I did get an interview for and was offered, would have required me to move my entire famliy and I was not prepared to do that.

During my time on the hunt for a new job, I found tutorials on making games and coding websites.  I immediately fell in love with it all.  I knew that even while I hunted for a new job in accounting that I wanted to do more.  I started my own business and built two mobile games that I published on Android and iOS.  I knew that making small games wouldn't instantly make me a millionaire and that is fine, but it reaffirmed my love for code.

After awhile of using tutorials freely available and through Udemy, I decided to pursue a more formal avenue to learn more quickly and to switch careers fulltime.  After researching many code schools, I have decided that Flatiron School is the best for me.  After the first few days, I knew I made the right choice.  I learned more about HTML and CSS in those first few lessons than I had learned in over a year of self-study.  I know I didn't learn more because something finally triggered in my brain, but because this curriculum is setup to help students learn the most and be successful.
