I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this journey with Flatiron School.  Now that I am at the beginning stages of working on Project #3, I feel like it is a good time to reflect back on the journey so far.

I had been working on the Bootcamp Prep course for a few months before I decided to take the plunge in the deep end and move to the full Online Web Developer Program.  I was rather apprehensive at first.  I knew I was going to be making a rather large commitment both financially and time-wise, but I felt like I was making a great decision.  It turns out that, so far at least, I was correct.

Each step of the way through the program the concepts are obviously building upon the previous ones taught, but it is the way the readings and labs are presented that makes it more effective.  They don't just present a concept and then isolated and present the next concept.  You build a lab with one concept and then with the next concept you still build the previous piece as well.  By the time you get to a major project, you don't even realize how much you really know how to do until you go to start the project and just start typing away.  Sure you will still need to look up some things from the course material or through other resources, but it always seems to be much less that I need to look up then I would have thought otherwise.  The Rails Course is over 100 lessons long, but yet I felt the most prepared for this project upon reaching that stage.

The support throughout the entire program has been great as well.  There are so many ways to get help from the chat to direct messages to one-on-one instructor support and feedback throughout the entire course.  I am very grateful for this course and for the way it is presented and supported.

I look forward to finishing the course itself and starting a new and wonderfully fulfilling career.  Now back to my project.
